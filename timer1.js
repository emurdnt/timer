//read the input
//go through the array
//multiply by a thousand because it's in milliseconds
//try recurssion on this one

//No numbers are provided: Easy. It should just not beep at all and end immediately since no beeps should get scheduled.
//An input is a negative number: Ignore/skip any numbers that are negative. We can't schedule anything in the past.
//An input is not a number: Ignore/skip these as well, instead of attempting to call setTimeout with a non-number.
